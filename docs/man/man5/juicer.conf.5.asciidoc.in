NAME
----
juicer.conf - juicer configuration file


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Sections and variables to use in your juicer configuration file. This
file is broken into two or more parts. The first is *DEFAULT* and the
rest are named after your environments, e.g., *qa*, *stage*, or
*prod*.

Assuming you have a *devel* and *prod* environment, you might have a
configuration file that looks like this:

[literal]
    # ~/.config/juicer/config - In this example config file we maintain two
    # environments: devel and prod.

    [DEFAULT]
    username: tux
    password: 5w33tP@ssw04d
    base_url: https://pulp.devel.int.tux.org/pulp/api
    # 'devel' is the base environment. This means juicer will default
    # to using 'devel' when commands are not specified with an
    # explicit environment(s).
    start_in: devel

    # If an environment requires signatures, specify an
    # rpm_sign_plugin. Here we've included MySweetPlugin, which will
    # serve to sign RPMs for us. See juicer.common.RpmSignPlugin.
    rpm_sign_plugin: juicer.plugins.MySweetPlugin

    # Carts are stored in a mongodb instance somewhere, this is the
    #  hostname of our mongodb server.
    cart_host: mongodb01.util.tux.org

    [devel]
    # Most of our configuration for this environment lives in the
    # DEFAULT section already, but we do need to tell Juicer where
    # this environment promotes to next.
    promotes_to: prod

    [prod]
    # username already defined in DEFAULT.
    password: 5w33t_AdM!n_P@ssw04d

    # Note that this is a different pulp server, so we must specify
    # the base_url once again.
    base_url: https://pulp.prod.int.tux.org/pulp/api

    # We specify that the production environment requires packages to
    # be signed.
    requires_signature: true
